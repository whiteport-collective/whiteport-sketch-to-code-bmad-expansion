  compliance_requirements:
    - MANDATORY: Use absolute paths (/docs/D-Components/) for all component references
    - MANDATORY: Apply Title-Case-With-Dashes naming for all files and folders
    - MANDATORY: Include WPS2C attribution section at document end
    - MANDATORY: Use proper header navigation format: **Previous Step**: ←
    - MANDATORY: Use proper header navigation format: **Next Step**: →
    - MANDATORY: Organize components using atomic/molecular/organism structure

sections:
  - id: sketch-image
    title: Sketch
    instruction: |
      Include a link to the corresponding sketch image using proper relative paths from Sketches/ subfolders.
      Use Title-Case-With-Dashes naming for all folders and files (URL-safe compatibility).
      Organize all visual assets in dedicated Sketches/ subfolders for professional file organization.
      example: ![Search Filter Modal - Desktop](Sketches/search-filter-modal_desktop_concept.jpg)

  - id: sketch-context
    title: Sketch Context
    instruction: |
      Provide a brief description of the user's current situation in the scenario.
      Describe what the page is going to accomplish in the overall value-adding process.
      Reference established project context from:
      - Project brief (business goals, language requirements, platform focus)
      - Trigger map (persona goals, driving forces)
      - Existing scenarios (established patterns and approaches)
      - Component library (reusable elements and naming conventions)

  - id: page-structure
    title: Page Structure
    instruction: |
      Create a hierarchical bullet list for each section, component, and piece of content on the page.
      This structure should describe the page from a top-down perspective.

  - id: referenced-components
    title: Referenced Components
    instruction: |
      List all reusable components from the central library that are used on this page.
      Follow the established link-first documentation pattern:
      
      Format: "#### → [Component Name](path/to/component.md)"
      Follow with: **State**, **Purpose**, **Features**, etc.
      
      Use the component folder structure: `docs/D-Components/[Type]/[Category]/[Component-Name]/[Component-Name].md`
      Apply Title-Case-With-Dashes naming throughout. Follow the "Component Rule": elements appearing twice become documented components with generic names.
      
      Example:
      ```
      #### → [Navigation Header Component](../../D-Components/Organism/Navigation/Navigation-Header/Navigation-Header.md)
      **State**: Dashboard Page variant
      **Purpose**: Primary navigation with user context awareness
      ```

  - id: interactions-and-effects
    title: Interactions and Effects
    instruction: |
      Describe any interactive parts, animations, or visual effects that will enrich the user experience.

  - id: content-and-assets
    title: Content and Assets
    instruction: |
      Describe the headlines, body text, and any other fixed text with specific examples.
      Ensure multi-line content matches the sketch's intended length and structure.
      Provide context-appropriate messaging that explains platform concepts clearly.
      For images and videos, provide a description of their purpose and content.
      Include multi-language content as specified in initial project context, formatted consistently.

  - id: open-questions
    title: Open Questions & Missing Information
    instruction: |
      Document any parts of the sketch that were purposefully left undefined.
      This section is for parts of the design that require further client confirmation or research.

  - id: document-attribution
    title: Document Attribution
    instruction: |
      MANDATORY: Add the following attribution section at the end of every WPS2C document:
      
      ---
      
      *[Document summary statement describing the document's purpose and value]*
      
      *Created and optimized by [Agent Name] ([agent-id]) - [Agent Title] using Whiteport Sketch-to-Code BMad Expansion methodology. Reference: [WPS2C GitHub Repository](https://github.com/whiteport-sketch-to-code-bmad-expansion). Documentation follows WPS2C Zero Tolerance Parentheses Policy & Professional Naming Conventions.*
      
      Replace placeholders with actual agent information and document-specific summary.
